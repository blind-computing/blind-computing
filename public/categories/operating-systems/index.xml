      <description>&lt;p&gt;As noted in my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blindcomputing.org/linux/state-of-accessibility/&#34;&gt;overview of Linux accessibility&lt;/a&gt;,
Debian has, for quite some
time now, been a very good choice for a blind user looking to get into
Linux. It offers a speech and braille enabled installer and automatically
sets up any necessary accessibility settings if they&amp;rsquo;re available,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It was the talk of the town when it came out! The new vision of Canonical, releasing there latest version of ubuntu (17.10) with &amp;hellip; the Gnome desktop? Running using wayland? Anyway, since this is a rather big change, we&amp;rsquo;ll go over the accessibility features of this new release so that anyone upgrading to 17.10, or to 18.04 when it comes out, will have a smooth transition.

      <description>Lots of blind and visually impaired people already know that apple has been designing their products with amazing accessibility built right in, ever since 2005 when mac os 10.4 tiger was released and the feature set has continued to grow over the years. But for those who aren&amp;rsquo;t up to speed, or who are looking to buy a mac but not sure if they can justify the extortionate price tag, this video will show you the main accessibility features of macOS I use and why I prefer Apple&amp;rsquo;s VoiceOver screenreader over any other.</description>

      <description>Ubuntu mate is quickly growing to be a well respected, clean, easy to use linux distrobution.It has the latest features, the coolest software and the best desktop interface (in my opinion), but does it have the accessibility features that blind/vi people need out of an operating system?
Actually, the answer looks very promising
here&amp;rsquo;s a quick video showing the accessibility features of ubuntu mate 16.04 lts.
