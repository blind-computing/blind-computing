      <description>An operating system is a big program that run&#39;s your device, whether it be a braille note taker, desktop, laptop or even a phone. Operating systems control the overall user interface as well as the underlying technologies that make today&#39;s computing world possible.
There is an overwhelming amount of operating systems out there, from windows, to mac OS10 ... I mean macOS because apple changed the name, to the thousands of linux distributions, right the way down to mobile operating systems like IOS and android.</description>

      <description>The main blind computing website has always been about giving blind and visually impaired computer users the most up to date information and tutorials we can, however, this poses the question, where do we get this information in the first place? That&#39;s what the Blind Computing Blog was created for. On it, we&#39;ll ask questions to the blind computing community, get answers via comments and talk about what we&#39;ve been up to lately.</description>
