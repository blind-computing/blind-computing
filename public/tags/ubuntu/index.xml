      <description>It was the video that kickstarted my youtube channel! My review of ubuntu mate 16.04 went down like a storm, becoming one of the most popular videos on my channel. But what about its Long Term Support successor? In this video, I take a look at the beta release of Ubuntu Mate 18.04 LTS.

      <description>It was the talk of the town when it came out! The new vision of Canonical, releasing there latest version of ubuntu (17.10) with &amp;hellip; the Gnome desktop? Running using wayland? Anyway, since this is a rather big change, we&amp;rsquo;ll go over the accessibility features of this new release so that anyone upgrading to 17.10, or to 18.04 when it comes out, will have a smooth transition.

      <description>Ubuntu mate is quickly growing to be a well respected, clean, easy to use linux distrobution.It has the latest features, the coolest software and the best desktop interface (in my opinion), but does it have the accessibility features that blind/vi people need out of an operating system?
Actually, the answer looks very promising
here&amp;rsquo;s a quick video showing the accessibility features of ubuntu mate 16.04 lts.
