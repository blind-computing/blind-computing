    A comparison (after hands-on) between Humanware's Braillenote Touch and Eurobraille's Esytime. This is the second article in a two part series.

**Note:** This was the second piece of content I ever made for this site. It's been converted and transferred many times, is at least 4 years old now and isn't formatted and layed out the best.

## Introduction

Recently, I started looking to get my old, tatty braillenote apex bt32
notetaker replaced with something new. I, along with my VI team at
school found 2 devices. The braillenote touch, which is a braille tablet
running android and with new features including touch braille (where you
can type in braille on the glass of the screen) and the esytime, a
braille laptop that runs full blown windows 7 (soon to be windows 10)
with some cool features as well. I then published the [first report]({{< relref "braillenote-touch-vs-esytime-before-hands-on.md" >}}) on
these devices, documenting all of my research up until that point. After
that, I got somebody from each side of the battle to come out and
demonstrate there product. This, my second report, is the most important
notes I found out from these people and further
research.

**I'll also publish a list of questions I had for theaformentioned
sails people later, so you can see what my thoughtprocess was.**

**Also note that this document was written for me and the VI team to
decide which device to buy, if any and was not originally meant to be
published here.**

## Similarities between both units

1.  Both devices seem to be bigger than my current braillenote apex. The
    braillenote seems to have a larger surface area, but the esytime
    seems to be thicker.

2.  Both units have standard cursor keys above the braille display.

3.  Both units have a 32 cell braille display. The braillenote touch has
    an option for an 18 cell display, but I'm not sure about the
    esytime.

4.  Both products have clear, sharp braille displays, at least to my
    fingers.

5.  They both are considerably more advanced and overall more useful
    than my braillenote apex.

6.  Both take longer to boot up from a cold start than my braillenote,
    but unless the devices crash, this shouldn't be an issue, because I
    can leave the chosen device in sleep mode.

7.  Both devices have a braille terminal, allowing the user to connect
    the display to another computer and enter/read text.

## Notes on the braillenote touch

1.  Runs android 4.4 kitkat, which is several versions out of date. It
    still does have security updates directly from google, however.

2.  The touch braille works remarkably better than I'm sure anybody
    expected and I can easily get used to it. The included keyboard is
    also very simple to use and it is not much different from the
    braillenote apex.

3.  Key math, which is the program used to enter math equasions, could
    come in very handy and once we work out the technical side of
    things, I could much more easily do class and home work using it.
    **NOTE: The esytime does integrate similar functionality, but I
    haven't tried it.**

4.  KNFB reader seems to work well enough (I gave it a bulletted list
    and it put all the numbers before the text, but that's managable).

5.  Because of the fact that the touch comes with android, the google
    integration (which will be useful for me in school) is very tight,
    as google makes android

6.  Because the braillenote touch has a screen, classwork will be easier
    because the teacher can read what's being entered at the press of a
    key (when editting text, only the braille dots show up on the
    display and you have to hit the visual preview button to see it as
    rendered text). The esytime requires an external display.

7.  The braillenote touch is much more customised than the esytime. In
    some ways, this is better and in others, it's worse. For example,
    the touch has it's own menu for selecting which voice to use,
    whereas the esytime relies on the screen reader's settings dialog.

8.  The braillenote has a built-in camera on the botton of the device,
    whereas the esytime does not have any camera. The esytime does have
    more usb ports though (3 compared to 1), so the required facilities
    are there to connect an external camera.

9.  One thing that bugs me is that the touch has changed the navigation
    keys from space and backspace, to space with dot one and space with
    dot 4 respectively. Thumb key navigation is still possible, but this
    is not how I use to navigate my apex. The esytime has, in my
    opinion, a better navigation controller (2 joy sticks that can, with
    the right screen reader, be customised to act as many different
    things, but by default, both act as the arrow keys).

## Notes on the esytime

1.  The device is made of metal and although this will make it heavier,
    I think it's better in the long run more durability.

2.  The design seems a little unconventional, with the top portion of
    the device being the braille display and the bottom being the
    braille keyboard. There are no thumb keys (panning is achieved
    through 2 buttons below the braille display on the left and right).
    There are also 2 space bars, the left hand one of which acts like
    the backspace key and the right hand one as a normal space. Both
    keys together act as enter. This is required because of the way
    screen readers interface with the keyboard.

3.  The keyboard it's self feels quite nice and is very quiet, though
    not as quiet as the touch braille.

4.  When using NVDA or window eyes, grade 2 can not be entered natively,
    however, the esysuite package provides the ability to bypass this
    limmitation and type in grade 2. Other screen readers support native
    grade 2 entry. This wouldn't really bug me that much, however.

5.  As mentioned in the first report, Any software program that can run
    on windows (the operating system of choice for the school) will
    work, even without an accessable framework in place. A mouse and
    screen can be connected and the esytime can be used just like my
    current laptop, even allowing for transcription to happen on the
    device itself (although this is not very practical).

6.  Like the braillenote, the esytime can attempt to use OCR to read PDF
    files, but there is no direct way to take a picture of something and
    have it appear on the screen.

7.  The esytime seems to be quite good with different types of braille,
    such as braille maths and braille music.

8.  The braille music functionality allows the creation of midi files, a
    feature that I could make much use of at home, although purely for
    fun.

9.  Unlike the braillenote touch, the esytime would allow me to do all
    of my computing work directly on it, as any programming language
    that can work under windows will work. Android will definitely not
    be able to do this.

10. Even with moddern technology, I still am unsure as to whether a
    spinning hard drive is a good idea in a school environment (I'm sure
    it would work fine?) But this shouldn't be a problem, as a solid
    state version is due to be released.

11. The esytime does not come with a case, nor is one available to my
    knolage. This shouldn't be much of a problem, but it's a
    consideration non the less.

## Summery

I'm still not sure which unit is better for me. Mainly because of the
computing work I'll have to do, I think the esytime is the better
braille device. But then again, the braillenote is already solid state,
requires somewhat less adjusting to and has touch braille. One thing is
for sure, they are both well designed, good products. It's just a
matter of do you want a braille tablet or a braille computer. Most
geeks, at least, would immediately say the latter, but then again, a
computer has more parts and is more complex than a tablet.

### Update 2020

In 2017, I ended up getting myself a brand new Braillenote Touch. I used
this device for about two and a half years, before moving on to using a
macbook with my own, home grown document creation workflow which I plan
to cover in another article. While I may still make an article reviewing
the Braillenote, the TL, DR is that it is a fantastic device that
revolutionised what a braille note-taker should be, but the original
version suffered from major slowdown and was overall underpowered and
out-dated (software wise that is). Humanware is now pushing the
[Braillenote Touch
Plus](https://store.humanware.com/hus/blindness-braillenote-touch-plus-32.html)
which, from what I've read and heard, looks like a much more
well-designed product. Existing Braillenote Touch users can upgrade
their devices if they wish.

Thanks for reading this epic of a report.
