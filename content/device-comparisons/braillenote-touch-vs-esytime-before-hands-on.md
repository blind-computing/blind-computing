    A comparison (before hands-on) between Humanware's Braillenote Touch and Eurobraille's Esytime. Originally personal notes I created.

**Note:** This was the first piece of content I ever made for this site. It's been converted and transferred many times, is at least 4 years old now and isn't formatted and layed out the best.

## Pros of the Braillenote Touch

1.  It is possible to trade in an old Braillenote in order to make use
    of a discount.
2.  It runs android, which will tie in very well with the Google
    services at school.
3.  Humanware gives a good in depth manual and FAQ. You can find the FAQ
    at: http://www.humanware.com/microsite/bntouch/faq.php
4.  The touch has a newer version of bluetooth. This is really not a
    concern, but it is something to be aware of.
5.  The touch allows you to write touch braille which can be silent. It
    also gives you the option of using a perkins keyboard, included in
    the package.
6.  The touch has a 7in touch screen, while the esytime does not include
    a built in display of any kind except the braille display.
7.  Humanware is, at least in my mind, a very well respected company who
    I've had good results with in the past. Although the Apex crashes
    quite a bit, I've seldom if ever, been in a class and not been able
    to use my Braillenote. Recently, The Braillenote gave me a message
    that there was an error on the flash disk, which jerked me in to
    "panick and back up all data" mode, which meant that I didn't use
    it for that lesson, however, that has only happened once and I've
    used it ever since.
8.  The Braillenote Touch uses an SD card to store all data. Not only

    card in case of a failure, but the card is transfereable between
    Braillenote Touches. This can be usefull if the device breaks, as if
    a Humanware care plan is put in place, then they'll ship you a
    loner unit for you to insert the SD card into. Note, however, that
    this costs more.
9.  Humanware provides Youtube tutorials called Braillenote Touch
    snapshots that show you exactly how the operating system and some of
    the hardware works.
10. The Braillenote Touch allows easy switching between 2 different
    language profiles, which changes the braille tables, as well as the
    speech system language.

## Cons of the Braillenote Touch

1.  The Braillenote Touch runs Android. While Android does integrate
    with Google services very well, all of the school's computers run
    Windows which means that the Esytime can technically run all of the
    same software, provided that the standard methods of implementing
    accessability have been deployed.
2.  I believe, although I haven't looked deeper than the FAQ at this
    time, that the Braillenote Touch will be more expensive than the
    Esytime, especially considering that I personally would much prefer
    a cell braille display (I feel as though a cell display would just
    be too small). When comparing this with the Esytime, which I believe
    has 32 cells as default, or even the Alva BC-640, which has 40
    cells, it is something that would be great, but is certainly not
    needed.
3.  The braillenote touch has an hdmi port, which while it provides
    better video quality, all of the school's moniters use VGA like my
    old braillenote. This might not matter, because the touch has a
    built in display, however.
4.  The Braillenote Touch runs Android version 4.4, which is a few years
    old at this time. This isn't much of a problem, as Google is still
    providing security updates to 4.4 and it is estimated that 50%+ of
    Android devices run a software version less than 4.4 anyway, so app
    availability isn't much of a problem. Never-the-less, 7.0 is the
    latest.

## Pros of the Esytime

1.  The Esytime ships with Windows 7 pre-installed. Since all of the
    school computers run Windows this would mean that technically, I
    could run any piece of software they wished, even if it's not
    accessible, just with a screen and keyboard where ever I happen to
    be.
2.  Euro Braille is a fairly new company, which means that ideas are
    still fresh over there.
3.  Because the Esytime is just an embedded computer, even if the
    company drops support for the device, as long as somebody is making
    drivers for any newer operating system (like Windows 10 or possibly
    a Linux distribution) we can potentially install that operating
    system over windows 7 to get continued support from the OS
    manufacturer.
4.  The Esytime can be bought with some other options, such as an SSD
    instead of a hard drive (which we probably don't need), an external
    DVD-RW drive (I've already got one I can use), the Windows 7 Pro
    upgrade (this is what the school is running. I don't think it's
    necessary).
5.  The Esytime provides more storage space, because it uses a standard
    laptop style hard disk drive. (#1)
6.  It is possible to install any screen reader of your choosing on the
    Esytime, as it is just a standard pc. It comes with NVDA as
    standard, so I can get up and running straight away.
7.  The Esytime can act as a braille display/terminal for another
    computer or an IOS device, such as an iPad. This is something I
    believe Humanware says that is not possible on the touch, or is not
    implemented yet (I believe it's the former).
8.  The Esytime, being Windows powered, will have better support for
    various devices, namely embossers and printers, when compared to the
    Android powered Braillenote Touch, which can print to any cloud
    print enabled printer.
9.  One option for the Esytime is a software package that is made for
    education. It offers a word processer that supports various braille
    languages, such as music braille. It also includes some extra
    programs, such as a calculater.

## Cons of the Esytime

1.  Because Euro Braille is a new company, they don't have any proven
    track record yet. I haven't sceen any reviews or pretty much any
    material about the Esytime on the internet, except the promotion.
2.  
3.  The Esytime runs Windows. When compared to Android, Windows needs
    virus protection, Malware bites and Spybot anti-spyware, and even
    then, it can slow down over time.
4.  I believe Windows 7's main stream support has ended, and I don't
    know what Microsoft are doing with extended support, as they are
    trying to push Windows 10 in everybody's faces.

### Conclusion

First off, I want to say that when comparing these two note takers, I
was able to find much more information about the Braillenote Touch. This
means that the validity of this document is slightly floored, because I
feel as though I'm giving the Esytime an unfair run for it's money.
Anyway, I would also like to say that I've considered and will get a
demo of each unit and will be posting a second report after the
hands-on. I do express concerns over the fact that Euro braille is a new
company, as with Optilec, well, let's just say that that experiment
didn't work very well (that's why I want a demo), in contrast with
Humannware, who have been making the Braille note family of products for
years. A fact that I can't seem to get over, that almost overwhelms the
previous thought, is that the Esytime is an Open Hardware platform. What
I mean by that is if you go to the promotion on their website, they list
the name of the processer and how much ram and what disk they use; from
that you can tell that all this machine is, is a PC in a small case with
a permanently installed braille display and keyboard. This is a massive
improvement over the Braillenote Touch. When the Touch is discontinued,
it won't get security updates, but if the Esytime is discontinued I can
just install something else, because it's just a PC.

Okay, so the big question. Which one will I pick? Well...

I still don't know. I'll have to try both products and decide which
one I like better in person. It's a very hard decision, because I love
the fact that that the Esytime is open, but practically, I feel as
though the touch will do better for me, at least at school. It's making
me choose between open hardware, which is very important to me and
practicallity, which obviously is crucial.

The [second installment of this report]({{< relref "braillenote-touch-vs-esytime-after-hands-on.md" >}}) is now available.
