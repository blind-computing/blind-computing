Discord is a rapidly growing chat platform. It is designed with gamers
in mind, but now almost every online community seems to have a discord
server, <!--more-->
including [the VIP Central Discord
server](https://discord.gg/rFHxWty) specifically made
for the Blind Computing community. But how accessible is it? Let's find
out!

## Update - May 2020

The video below is a few years old now. I've left it up here for
historical purposes, but a lot has changed in that time, and Discord is
now much more accessible, if not absolutely perfect yet. I'd incourage you
to check the comments of this video, as I've been posting updates there
and I plan to write an up-to-date article about this topic in the future.
