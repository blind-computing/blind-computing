Ubuntu mate is quickly growing to be a well respected, clean, easy to
use linux distrobution.It has the latest features, the coolest software
and the best desktop interface (in my opinion), but does it have the
accessibility features that blind/vi people need out of an operating
system?

Actually, the answer looks very promising
