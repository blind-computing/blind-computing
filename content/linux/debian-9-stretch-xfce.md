As noted in my
[overview of Linux accessibility]({{< ref "/linux/state-of-accessibility.md" >}}),
Debian has, for quite some
time now, been a very good choice for a blind user looking to get into
Linux. It offers a speech and braille enabled installer and automatically
sets up any necessary accessibility settings if they're available,
<!--more-->
no matter which desktop environment you choose.

This video explores the accessibility options provided by both Debian
itself, as well as the XFCE desktop, and mentions a few important things
to consider if you want to go with this combination.
