It was the talk of the town when it came out! The new vision of
Canonical, releasing there latest version of ubuntu (17.10) with ... the Gnome
desktop? Running using wayland?  Anyway, since this is a rather big
change, we'll go over the accessibility features of this new release
so that anyone upgrading to 17.10, or to 18.04 when it comes out, will
have a smooth transition.
