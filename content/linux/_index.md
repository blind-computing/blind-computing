Commonly referred to as simply _Linux,_ (**note:** I'm not getting into
the discussion about how correct this is), GNU / Linux is a collection
of projects that come together to form a customisable, flexible and most
importantly free and open source ecosystem of operating systems.

Linux is very configurable, to the point where multiple flavours
(distributions) of it are available, each with their own set of
applications, working environment\[s\] and design philosophy.

This section aims to explore the accessibility options that are
available when using Linux, as well as providing tips, tricks and how
tos on how to set up and use these tools on various Linux distributions.

Ecosystem are relatively hard to grasp at first, so I wrote
[an article]({{< relref "what-is-linux.md" >}}) that goes into greater detail.
