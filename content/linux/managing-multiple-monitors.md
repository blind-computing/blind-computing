  A video explaining how to lay out and configure multiple monitors in Linux, without needing sight.
---

I don't have a lot of sight. Certainly, I don't have enough to be able to
read with. But I do like to use the sight I do have to better visualise
what's happening on my computer. For this reason, and to make it easier to
see and manage multiple windows at once, I use tripple monitors on my main
computer (see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0207Ajz1Mrw)
for an overview of my setup).

This video explains how I set up and manage such a monitor arrangement
within Linux.
