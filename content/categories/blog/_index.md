The main blind computing website has always been about giving blind and
visually impaired computer users the most up to date information and
tutorials we can, however, this poses the question, where do **we** get
this information in the first place? That\'s what the Blind Computing
Blog was created for. On it, we\'ll ask questions to the blind computing
community, get answers via comments and talk about what we\'ve been up
to lately.
