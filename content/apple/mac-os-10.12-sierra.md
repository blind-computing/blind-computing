Lots of blind and visually impaired people already know that apple has
been designing their products with amazing accessibility built right in,
ever since 2005 when mac os 10.4 tiger was released and the feature
set has continued to grow over the years.  But for those who aren't
up to speed, or who are looking to buy a mac but not sure if they can
justify the extortionate price tag, this video will show you the main
accessibility features of macOS I use and why I prefer Apple's VoiceOver
screenreader over any other.
