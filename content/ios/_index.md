iOS, much like [macOS]({{< ref "/mac-os" >}}), has a great reputation
when it comes to accessibility. Many blind / VI users use iPhones and
iPads powered by iOS every day, and it's at least partially to blame for
the creation of this website, given how much time I spent, in my younger
years, learning by browsing the web and watching YouTube on an iPad. In
fact, I still use an iPad as my primary computing device today.

This page, you guessed it, aims to document the accessibility features
of iOS and its associated operating systems (iPad OS, tvOS, watchOS, etc).
