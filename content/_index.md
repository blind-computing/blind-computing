## What is Blind Computing?

This website is the hub of content for blind and visually impaired users
that use a computer. We will cover as much as we can, from blind/vi
devices, to the latest operating systems, down to accessible tools,
programs and web sites that contributors have found useful.

Blind computing was started out of the demise of braillenoteusers.info,
a site that I used a lot and found very helpfull. It aims to reconstruct
the library of braillenote content on that site, however, we plan to
cover a much broader scope of topics that are not necessarily related to
the braille note.

## how to contribute

Please see the [contributing
page]({{% ref "contributing.md" %}}) for more information.

## Note on Browser Support

If you're on Linux or Windows, we recommend you view this site in
mozilla firefox, found at [the firefox download
page](https://firefox.com/download). Other browsers might work, but in
general, firefox is more accessible anyway.

On a mac or iOS device, the built-in Safari browser seems to work fine
as well. Chrome appears to be the second choice.
