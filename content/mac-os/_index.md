Its considered one of the most accessible computing platforms, with
Apple pouring lots of money into the  VoiceOver screen reader, as
well as the rest of its accessibility stack. MacOS is well-known in
the blind / VI community. Some love it for its braud accessibility,
workflow and complimentary applications like the iLife suite; Some hate
it for being locked down, not customisable and tightly integrated with
Apple's ecosystem.

This page aims to document the accessibility features of macOS and how
to best use them.
